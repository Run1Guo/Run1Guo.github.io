                    Obi-Wan Kenobi was a Jedi Master who served on the Jedi High Council during the final years of the Republic Era.
                    As a Jedi General, Kenobi served in the Grand Army of the Republic that fought against the Separatist Droid Army during the Clone Wars.
                    Kenobi, however, was forced into exile as a result of the Great Jedi Purge.
                    As a mentor, Kenobi was responsible for training two members of the Skywalker family,
                    Anakin and Luke Skywalker, both of whom served in turn as his Padawan in the ways of the Force.

                    Anakin Skywalker was a legendary Force-sensitive human male who was a Jedi Knight of the Galactic Republic
                    and the prophesied Chosen One of the Jedi Order, destined to bring balance to the Force.
                    Also known as "Ani" during his childhood, Skywalker earned the moniker "Hero With No Fear"
                    from his accomplishments in the Clone Wars. His alter ego, Darth Vader, the Dark Lord of the Sith,
                    was created when Skywalker turned to the dark side of the Force, pledging his allegiance to the Sith Lord Darth Sidious
                    at the end of the Republic Era.

                    Qui-Gon Jinn was a venerable if maverick Jedi Master who lived during the last years of the Galactic Republic.
                    He was a wise and well-respected member of the Jedi Order, and was offered a seat on the Jedi Council,
                    but chose to reject in order to follow his own path.
                </p>

                <p class="JediBlue">
                    A year prior to the Invasion of Naboo, Jinn followed a call from the Force guiding him to the planet Chandrila,
                    where he discovered the orphaned Force-sensitive boy known as Jarik Shan,
                    and brought him to the Jedi Temple on Coruscant to be trained as a Jedi.
                    A year later Jinn would also encounter Anakin Skywalker on Tatooine and,
                    convinced he had found the Chosen One, brought him to the Jedi Temple as well.
                    His dying wish was for Skywalker to become a Jedi and ultimately restore balance to the Force.
